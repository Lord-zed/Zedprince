    "The chi-square test also known as the \"Expected vs Observed\" Test. It is a way to answer the question: \"Is the difference between what I observed and what I expected too big to be just a coincidence?\"\n",

    "- If the difference is small, it's probably just random chance. Your initial idea might be correct.\n",

    "- If the difference is large, it's unlikely to be a coincidence. Your initial idea is probably wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common specific uses are:\n",
    "1) Goodness-of-Fit Test: Testing if your sample data fits a known or expected distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: You think a die is fair (each number should have a 1/6 chance). You roll it 60 times and count how many times each number appears. The Chi-Square test checks if your observed rolls fit the expected distribution of a fair die\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Test of Independence: Testing if two categorical variables are related or independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: You want to see if there's a relationship between gender (Male/Female) and preference for a new product (Like/Dislike). You survey people and put the counts in a table. The Chi-Square test checks if the variables are independent (no relationship) or dependent (there is a relationship).\n",

    "# ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA (for comparing more than two means) ANOVA Test is used to analyze the differences among the means of various groups using certain estimation procedures. ANOVA means analysis of variance. ANOVA test is a statistical significance test that is used to check whether the null hypothesis can be rejected or not during hypothesis testing. An ANOVA test can be either one-way or two-way depending upon the number of independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Key Question ANOVA Answers:\n",
    "\"Is the variance BETWEEN the groups significantly larger than the variance WITHIN the groups?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If BETWEEN > WITHIN: The differences between the group means are bigger than what you'd expect from random chance alone. The factor (e.g., the fertilizer type) likely has a real effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "If BETWEEN = WITHIN: The differences between the group means are about the same as the natural variation within the groups. The factor probably doesn't have a real effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "TYPES\n",
    "\n",
    "One Way ANOVA One way ANOVA test is used to determine whether there is any difference between the means of three or more groups. A one way ANOVA will have only one independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Way ANOVA The two way ANOVA has two independent variables. Thus, it can be thought of as an extension of a one way ANOVA where only one variable affects the dependent variable. A two way ANOVA test is used to check the main effect of each independent variable and to see if there is an interaction effect between them."
